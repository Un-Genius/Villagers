1
	obj_player main sprite is messed up by the draw grid object.
	It tries to draw self but it needs to get rid of itself.
2
	obj_player doesnt move ---> var move is always set to 0
	test around to see if its the moveS fault


USEFUL BUT IN THE WAY:

sprite_index = asset_get_index("spr_player_" + state + string(dir));

//moving
var moving = hsp!=0 || vsp!=0;


// DIRECTION
if (moving){ 
    var _dir = point_direction(0, 0, hsp, vsp); 
    dir = floor(_dir/90);
}

// X Collision
if			 place_meeting		(x + hsp, y, obj_house0) {
	while	!place_meeting		(x + sign(hsp), y, obj_house0) {
								 x += sign(hsp);
	}
	if(dir = 0) x -= 1;
	if(dir = 2) x += 1;
	hsp = 0;
	//state = "collision";
}

// Y Collision
if			 place_meeting		(x, y + vsp, obj_house0) {
	while	!place_meeting		(x, y + sign(vsp), obj_house0) {
								 y += sign(vsp);
	}
	if(dir = 1) y += 1;
	if(dir = 3) y -= 1;
	vsp = 0;
	//state = "collision";
}
